## Anisha Hirani

Before becoming a Makers graduate, I was an A-Level student as well as a part-time Maths and English tutor. I chose to have coding experience via makers as they mimic a real life work experience. I am excited about being able to create a product that can have a great impact on society by using my problem solving and strategic skills.

## Work Experience

**Explore Learning** (Feb 2021 - Dec 2022)  
_Tutor_

- Communicating with parents and providing relevant child feeback.
- Taking out extra time to plan lessons according to the child's ability.

## Skills

#### Effective communication

- During my time as a tutor I was able to explain complex concepts to students with different learning abilities in a clear and concise way. This is valuable in software development where effective communication is essential with teamwork and explaining technical details to non-technical workers and writing clear and understandable code. 

#### Attention to detail

- Having this skill is essential in software development, where even small errors can cause significant problems and impact the performance of the software. Similarly, I used this skill throughout my time as a tutor when I was grading assignments and providing feedback to parents and student, to make sure anything of importance wasn't missing that could potentially hinder a child's future.

#### Problem-solving

- With my previous job role, I was often helping students work through challenging problems by breaking them down into smaller parts and providing the correct guidance along the way. This skill is critical in software development, where problem-solving is a key component of building software and addressing technical issues that arise during development.
