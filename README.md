## Anisha Hirani

Before becoming a Makers graduate, I was an A-Level student as well as a tutor within the education sector. I chose to have coding experience via makers as they mimic a real life work experience. I am excited about being able to create a product that can have a great impact on society by using my problem solving and strategic skills. I was inspired by seeing how vital technology was within the current education system. This pushed me further to take up code and stem a career out of it. After completing Makers Academy, I pride myself on skills such as TDD and agile methodologies, as well as greatly enjoy pair programming. 

I am currently heavily involved with a non-profit organisation called HSS UK and have been for the past 14 years which instils the ethos of hard work, good morals, selfless working and aligns with my passion for tech for good. I have multiple years of experience with teamwork and using effective communication. This means that I have been managing my time between studies, the organisation and my personal life successfully for a number of years and have gained various skills and qualities that I can apply to this role.

## Skills

#### Effective communication

- During my time as a tutor I was able to explain complex concepts to students with different learning abilities in a clear and concise way. I would regularly speak to my colleagues, as well as the parents to find the best way to deliver my lessons so that the learner could get the full benefit. Upon taking their feedback, I would resort to the use of more visual techniques as that is the source of where most children thrived. This is valuable in software development where effective communication is essential with teamwork and explaining technical details to non-technical workers and writing clear and understandable code. 

#### Attention to detail

- Having this skill is essential in software development, where even small errors can cause significant problems and impact the performance of the software. Similarly, I used this skill throughout my time as a tutor when I was grading assignments in order to fully understand the areas the child was struggling and the areas they needed more support in, which then helped me provide the relevant feedback to the parents and student, to make sure anything of importance wasn't missing that could potentially hinder a child's future. 

#### Problem-solving

- With my previous job role, I was often helping students work through challenging problems and I approached this through assessing the learners need and then by breaking the problems down into smaller parts. I would then provide the correct guidance through probing questions to understand where they were in order to tailor my approach to their learning. When coding on the Acebook project, my pairs and I came across a blocker where I could give support by breaking down the problem and going step by step from the point where first had confusion. This skill is critical in software development, where problem-solving is a key component of building software and addressing technical issues that arise during development.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Oct 2022 - Feb 2023)

A 16-week intensive software development focussed on the following skills:
- Object-Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, Minimum Viable Product and much more
- Collaborating in teams with an Agile methodology
- Pair programming frequently throughout the course
- Debugging and using my own initiative to tackle problems, particularly on the Acebook project as that had parts of pre-written code that we had never seen before.
- As well as pair programming there was a lot of self-learning
